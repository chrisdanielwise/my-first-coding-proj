                <h1>THE BIGGEST UNIVERSITY IN IKOT EKPENE</h1>
                <p>Ritman University (RU) is a response to the yearning of renascent Africans for an entrepreneurial university that develops the mind
for total productivity, inculcates positive values and offers resources for navigating the world with ease. The National Universities Commission’s accreditation of all academic programmes currently offered here and granting of full license to operate in less than four years of our existence affirms RU’s total commitment to offering quality scholarship driven by amply qualified intellectuals and adequate learning infrastructure. The Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien-led Ritman Group of Companies – a conglomerate with interests in Agriculture, Civil &amp; Electrical Engineering, Hospitality, Information/Communication Technology, Printing, Furniture-making and Education – which began operation on 30 March 1987 regards kick-off of RU on November 23 2015 as the Zenith of her educational establishments, after several years of planning. Ritman University is located about a kilometre from Ikot Ekpene city centre. It sits on 104.2 acres of lush, serene tropical environment with clean and green ambience ideal for serious
academic work. The campus in Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom State lies between Aba and Umuahia (in Abia State of Nigeria) and Uyo, the capital. It is easily accessible from Calabar, Eket, Uyo, Port Harcourt Aba and Umuahia. </p>
